In personal residences in and around the national capital, there are set timings for water
distribution which is handled by the delhi jal board or a similar organisation. In most
households, the residents are required to switch on and off the motor daily which fills up the
water tank and do so through an intuitive estimate. There is a need to automate the process
which enables an efficient usage of peopleâ€™s time and also promotes water management.
Our product tracks the water going into the tank; gives out data for previous water
consumption sorted by specific day of the week, month etc. and also tells the temperature of
the tank in real time. Also, one can set the amount of water to be filled in the tank each day
beforehand and even remotely. Constant alerts are also given when excess water
consumption is detected.
